  recipe: Kale Salad with Toasted Pita and Parmesan
  instructions:
  - ''
  - "      Pull the kale leaves from the stems. Take a handful at a time in one fist,
    then carefully pull back your fingers one inch at a time as you slice the bunched
    kale into fine shreds. Place the shredded kale in a colander and rinse well. Allow
    the kale to dry as you prepare the remaining ingredients."
  - "      "
  - "      Cut the pita into 1-inch triangles. Place the pita triangles in a small
    bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Toss the pita until it is well coated in oil.
    Heat a small skillet over medium, then once the skillet is hot, add the pita.
    Cook and stir the pita until they are toasted and crunchy."
  - "      "
  - "      Remove the pita from the skillet, then add the chopped walnuts. Stir and
    cook the walnuts in the dry skillet for 1-2 minutes, or just until they begin
    to smell toasty. Remove them from the skillet immediately to prevent burning."
  - "      "
  - "      To assemble the salad, place the washed and dried kale in a large bowl.
    Add the toasted pita, walnuts, Parmesan, and golden raisins. Pour the champagne
    vinaigrette over top, then toss until everything is coated in dressing and Parmesan."
  - "      "
  - "      Serve the salad immediately, or let it rest for 10-15 minutes to allow
    the dressing to slightly soften the kale."
